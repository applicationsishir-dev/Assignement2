total_sum = 0

A variable named total_sum is initialized to 0.

It will store the cumulative sum of the numbers.

for i in range(1, 51):

The for loop runs from 1 to 50.

In Python, range(1, 51) includes 1 but excludes 51, so the loop stops at 50.

total_sum += i

In each iteration, the current value of i is added to total_sum.

This gradually builds the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50.

print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is:", total_sum)

After the loop completes, this line prints the final calculated sum.
