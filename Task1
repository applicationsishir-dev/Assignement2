num = int(input("Enter a numberr: "))

The input() function takes a value from the user as text.

int() converts that text into an integer and stores it in the variable num.

if num % 2 == 0:

The modulus operator % finds the remainder when num is divided by 2.

If the remainder is 0, the number is even.

print(f"{num} is an even number.")

This line executes when the condition is true.

An f-string is used to display the number along with the message.

else:

This block runs when the if condition is false.

print(f"{num} is an odd number.")

This prints the result when the number is not divisible by 2, meaning it is odd.
